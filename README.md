# Using `clearfix` to clear floated content

## Problem Statement

Float is a property that can optionally position the content left or right.
It can be used for columns, or to create a "wrap" effect with text and
media elements. When `float` is used elements, will start to fill up whitespace
wherever they will fit. This is not always the intended effect, so how can
we undo this functionality when we need to content to break? This is where
the technique of `clearfix` comes in.

layout. As a result, using the `clear` property when needed can be a life-saver!
